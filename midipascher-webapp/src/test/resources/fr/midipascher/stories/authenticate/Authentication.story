Narrative:
Given I provide credentials
When I send authentication-required requests
It should either succeed or fail

Scenario: create food specialty with wrong uid should fail
Given I authenticate with <uid> uid and whatever password
And I send <request-contenttype>

When I send a create food specialty request
Then I should get an unsuccessfull response
And the response code should be 401
And the error message should be <message>
